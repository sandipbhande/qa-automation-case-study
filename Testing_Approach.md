# Testing Approach

1) Automation Strategy
- Login functionality automated using Selenium WebDriver
- PyTest used for test execution and reporting


2)  Framework Design
- Page Object Model to separate test logic and UI locators
- Test data stored externally in JSON format

3)  Reporting
- HTML reports generated using pytest-html
- Screenshots captured on failures

4) CI Readiness
- Framework can be integrated with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
